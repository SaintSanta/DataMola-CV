## Summary
I specialized in designing industrial buildings and structures before a career change. My previous job involved high responsibility and teamwork along with the necessity to create a design in strict compliance with regulatory documents

In 2020, I decided to change my life. Since that time for now, I'm working for that.

You can ask me, ¬´Why is front-end?¬ª It's simple: I like the process when you write some code and then you can see what happens on the screen. I remember, how I was excited, when my first app worked! I started to dig deeper and learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

So, I intend to take all the skills I've learned to become a mighty front-end developer.
